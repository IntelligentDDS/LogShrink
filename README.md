# LogShrink: Effective Log Compression Tool
**Under Construction!!!**

The repository is the implementation of paper in ICSE 2024 (early) "LogShrink: Effective Log Compression by Leveraging Commonality and Variability of Log Data".

By Xiaoyun Li, Hongyu Zhang, Van-Hoang Le, Pengfei Chen


### Abstract
As systems grow in scale, log data generation has become increasingly explosive, leading to an expensive overhead on log storage, such as several petabytes per day in production. To address this issue, log compression has become a crucial task in reducing disk storage while allowing for further log analysis. Based on these observations, we propose LogShrink, a novel and effective log compression method by leveraging commonality and variability of log data.

### Dataset
We use 16 representative log datasets from [loghub](https://zenodo.org/record/3227177).The details of the dataset is shown as belows:

### How to run it
#### Environment Requirements
- python >=3.8
- gcc>=9.4.0

Python package requirements can be installed by `pip install -r requirements.txt`


#### Run demo

- Example of LogShrink on Linux with LZMA zip tool:
```console
# compile log parser
cd python_compression/parser
make 

# run the compression part given a series of paramters. 
cd ..
python3 run.py -I ../test_logs/ -ds Linux -E E -C -K lzma -V -P -wh 50 -th 10 -NC 16 -S -outdir ./out/out -T ./templates
```
- The corresponding decompression command:
```
# run the decompression part given a series of parameters
cd decompression
python3 decompress_run.py -E E -K lzma -I ../out/out/Linux/ -T ../template/ -O ./restore_results
```
- More explanations of parameters:
  
```
python3 run.py -h
python3 decompression_run.py -h
```


### Experimental Results
We show the overall performance of LogShrink and our ablation studies on clustering based sequence sampler and analyzer here.
